                <p>React is a java Script library that creates user interfaces
                    in a predicatble and efficient way using declarative code. 
                    we use react component to break down code and create component 
                    display the information.
                </p>
            </div>
                <h2>Difference between props and State</h2>
                <p>
                    The key difference between props and state is that state is 
                    internal and controlled by the component itself while props are 
                    external and controlled by whetever renders the component.
                </p>
            <div>

            </div>
        </div>
